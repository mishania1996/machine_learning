#How It Works
#this model accepts an input with a single feature "input_shape=(1,)" and a single output
#Training Phase: During training, the model is trained on the 60% of the data.
#Validation Phase: After each epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on the 40% validation data. This helps in monitoring the modelâ€™s performance and tuning hyperparameters to prevent overfitting.
